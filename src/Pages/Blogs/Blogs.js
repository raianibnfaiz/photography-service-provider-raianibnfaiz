                <p className='text-justify mt-5'><span className="text-blue-700 mr-1">Answer:</span> Authentication verifies who the user is. On the other hand, authorization determines what resources a user can access. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. But authorization always takes place after authentication. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user whereas authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>

                <p className='text-justify mt-5'><span className="text-blue-700 mr-1">Answer:</span>STYTCH is a staunch supporter of password-less authentication. Ory brings complete user experience control with its headless user authentication management. Supabase calls itself an open-source Firebase alternative. Okta is again a flagbearer of password-less security. However, you can ask for the strongest passwords with Okta as well.</p>
